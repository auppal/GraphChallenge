The goal of the scripts in this folder is to enable the fast, parallel, in-memory generation
of immense power-law Kronecker graphs with exactly computable theoretical properties.

Requirements:
* D4M library to represent hypersparse distributions : https://github.com/Accla/d4m

* pMatlab library to run the program in parallel : https://www.ll.mit.edu//mission/cybersec/softwaretools/pmatlab/pmatlab.html
